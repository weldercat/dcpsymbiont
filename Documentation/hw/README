Hardware setup
--------------

There are two known to me ways to connect a DCP phone to
the PC - the hard one and the expensive one :)

DCP phones support two kinds of physical layer - 
2-wire ISDN Up0 and something like a strange proprietory 
 4-wire cross-breed between T1-AMI PHY with ISDN-Up0 packet format.

As far as I know there are no open info on these 4-wire 
transmitters so we'll focus on 2-wire link.

First of all you need an ISDN card.

If you're lucky you may find the ISDN card with a Up0 ports.
I heard that there are such beasts somewhere.

If so, you can just plug your DCP phone into the ISDN card,
provide phantom power (Definity switch puts -48VDC but the phone can 
run on as low as -24VDC) and if everything is ok, the phone will 
power and you may get to the software configuration.

Unfortunately most of the cheap ISDN cards come with S/T ports
instead of Up0. In that case you may try to find S/T to Up0 converters - 
they are quite expensive though.

One european company that makes these devices asked 
something around EUR300 for one converter unit! 
IMHO this is crazy.

So, here goes the hard way - you can use one DCP phone 
to act as line termination for another DCP phone!
For this to work your ISDN card must have IOM/2 bus output 
(Junghanns HFC-4S has one) and the phone you've choosen
to become line termination must be of specific vintage -
8410D that has separate SBC controller.

These are distinguishable by following traits:
- handset cord jack is on the left side (while looking on the phone 
  when it's right in front of you) (jack is not on the bottom side).
 
- has blue "shift" button (not the blue "ring" button).

- asks for speakerphone calibration upon startup.

Then you have to have basic soldering skills and 
basic understanding of digital circuits.

Unfortunately I havent taken pictures when working on these
modifications so I'll provide only brief instructions 
of what to do next.

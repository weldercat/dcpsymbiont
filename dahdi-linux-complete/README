This is a simple-to-install 'complete' DAHDI kit for Linux users. It
is designed to be a drop-in replacement for users used to building
Zaptel 1.2 or 1.4 for their system without specifying any special
build options, file locations, or anything else. If you need to
influence the build or installation process in any way outside the
defaults, you will need to use the installation steps specific to the
dahdi-linux and dahdi-tools packages separately (both of which are
located in subdirectories of the dahdi-complete package).

To install this package, execute these commands:

Step 1)

$ make all

This will build the dahdi-linux kernel modules for your
currently-running Linux kernel, and the dahdi-tools userspace tools.

Step 2)

$ make install

You will need to run this step as root (or via sudo or some
equivalent), to install the kernel modules and userspace tools on your
system.

Step 3 (optional))

$ make config

Again you will need to run this step as root or equivalent; this step
is only needed if you want to install the sample DAHDI configuration
files and init script and have not previously installed them.

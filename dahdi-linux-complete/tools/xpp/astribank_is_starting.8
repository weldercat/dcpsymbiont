.SH NAME
astribank_is_starting \- Mark / check is a Xorcom Astribank (xpp) is starting
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B astribank_is_starting [\-d] [\-v] [\-t \fItimeout\fB] <\-a|\-r|\-w>

.B astribank_is_starting [\-d] [\-v]

.B astribank_is_starting \-h

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B astribank_is_starting
is an internal tool used by various xpp scripts to mark that there may
be an Astribank device currently initializing, and to check for that mark.

Technically the mark is a SysV semaphore.

.SH OPTIONS
.B \-a
.RS
.B Add.
Set the mark. Should return 0 unless there's an error.
.RE

.B \-r
.RS
.B Remove.
Reset the mark. Should return 0 unless there's an error.
.RE

.BI \-t timeout
.RS
.B Timeout.
Set the timeout value for the \fB\-w\fR option. Default is 60 seconds.
.RE

.B \-w
.RS
.B Wait.
Wait for mark to be reset. Should return 0 unless there's an error.
.RE

Without \-a or \-r: return 0 if the mark has been set, or a non-zero value
otherwise.

.B \-d
.RS
Print debug information to stderr.
.RE

.B \-v
.RS
Verbose execution.
.RE

.B \-h
.RS
Displays usage message.
.RE

.SH FILES
.B /proc/sysvipc/sem
.RS
If set, the astribank should appear there with the ID 11211168 (0xAB11A0).
Naturally the ID (or rather, the usage of a semaphore in the first place)
is an implementation detail that may change.
.RE

.SH NOTES
.B astribank_is_starting
is used to mark the fact that an Astribank may be currently reenumerating
(technically: distonnecting and connecting as a new USB device) after
loading the firmware. Thus the script that loads the firmware 
(/usr/share/dahdi/xpp_fxloader) uses this utility to set the mark.

The mark is reset by /usr/share/dahdi/waitfor_xpds , which is typically
run by the DAHDI init script and waits for all Astribanks to finish
loading.

Q: Why do you use a semaphore?

A: because, unlike the filesystem, it is writable at any given time.

.SH BUGS
Option ordering matter. The \fB\-v\fR and \fB\-d\fR options should preceed
the actions (\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-r\fR and \fB\-w\fR).
The \fB\-t\fItimeout\fR option should preceed the \fB\-w\fR option.

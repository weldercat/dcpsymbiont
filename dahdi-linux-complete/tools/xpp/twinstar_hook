# This is an experimental script to activate an Astribank TwinStar
# during failover.
#
# The script assume that there is an /etc/dahdi/xpp_order file
# specifying the Astribanks' labels according to the required
# registration order.
#
# This file can be easily generated by running:
#    dahdi_genconf xpporder
# after the system is configured and working.

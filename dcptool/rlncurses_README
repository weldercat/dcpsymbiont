# Example demonstrating combining of readline and ncurses

## Features

Supports seamless and efficient terminal resizing and multibyte/combining/wide characters.
(Wide characters are those that use more than one terminal column.)

One of the trickier aspects is that readline only exports the cursor 
position as a byte offset (`rl_point`), which won't correspond to 
the correct terminal cursor column for many strings with special characters. 
We therefore have to calculate the terminal cursor column ourselves. 
readline itself does it as part of the default `rl_redisplay()` function.

## Limitations

* Some invalid strings and meta characters could still cause the cursor 
position to be off (though it's only a visual annoyance).

* Entering multibyte characters during search (e.g., **Ctrl-R**) does 
not work. This is due to a readline issue: 
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-readline/2015-02/msg00026.html. 
A workaround would be to buffer bytes until they form a complete multibyte character.

This problem also goes away if readline is allowed to read directly 
from stdin (e.g., via a `select` loop). I have a WIP that uses that 
approach in a branch for [another project](https://github.com/ulfalizer/botniklas). 
I could push it on request.
 
* To keep things simple, the readline (bottom) window does not scroll. 
It would require some care to get special characters right. ncurses pads might be handy.

The contents of the top window is set to whatever is entered. To exit, press **Ctrl-D** on an empty line.

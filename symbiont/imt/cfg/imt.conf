[general]
; This section keep general settings for the analog module

; echocancel: boolean: Automatically enable or disable individual line echo
; canceller on call begin/end
; If missing or invalid, no automatic echo canceller operation will be done
; This parameter can be overridden in group and line sections
; The hardware driver must support this feature
echocancel=yes

; call-ended-target: string: Target to play when an FXS line is disconnected and
; the FXO is still off hook
; This option is used to set an announcement to the FXO to tell it that the call
; was ended by its peer
; This parameter is applied on reload and can be overridden in group sections
; Defaults to tone/busy
call-ended-target=tone/busy

; outoforder-target: string: Target to play when an FXS line is disconnected and
; the FXO is off hook for a long period of time
; This tone is played after the call ended tone
; This parameter is applied on reload and can be overridden in group sections
; Defaults to tone/outoforder
outoforder-target=tone/outoforder

; lang: string: Language for tones played by the analog module
; This parameter is added to the call.preroute message dispatched by an FXS line
; This parameter is applied on reload and can be overridden in group sections
;lang=

; call-ended-playtime: integer: The time to play the call-ended-target prompt on an FXS line
; After that, the outoforder-target will be played until the user closes (set on hook) the line
; This parameter can be overridden in group sections
; Defaults to 2000
;call-ended-playtime=

; ring-timeout: integer: The time allowed to ellapse between rings on incoming calls on FXO lines
; This timer can be used when there is no way to know when the remote FXS closes an unaswered
; call (no line polarity changes)
; This timer can also be used to configure the FXO lines belonging to recorder (monitor) groups
; If used, incoming unaswered calls or recorders will be terminated when this time ellapsed
; This parameter can be overridden in group and line sections
; Set to 0 to disable this timer. Defaults to 10000
;ring-timeout=

; alarm-timeout: integer: The time allowed for an active call to remain alive with its line
; in alarm (out of order)
; A T1 line can detect link failures and notify the upper layer
; When notified on line failure, active unanswered calls are terminated immediately.
; Answered calls are allowed to persist for the given period
; Set to 0 to disable this timer. Defaults to 30000
;alarm-timeout=30000

;[group-name]
; This section is used to configure a group of analog lines

; enable: boolean: This option is used to create or remove a group of analog lines
; Applied on reload
; Defaults to yes
;enable=yes

; type: string: Group type. This is the type of the local end of all analog lines
; currently unused.
;type=

; spans: string: Specify the span(s) containing the analog channel(s)
; The value of this option must be a section name specified in a telephony module
; Multiple spans may be specified by simply separating them with a comma (',') character
; This option is required on creation if group's type is not monitor
;spans=

; useallcircuits: boolean: Create lines for all circuits belonging to this group
; This parameter is processed only when creating lines
; If disabled, only lines declared in existing sections with will be created
; Use line sections to override group parameters
; Defaults to enable
;useallcircuits=enable

; dtmfinband: boolean: Enable to send the DTMF data in band on analog lines belonging
; to this group
; If disabled, the DTMF will be sent through the line's hardware if possible
; This parameter just set the order to try sending the DTMFs: if disabled and the line
; fails to send the DTMF through the hardware, it will send it in band
; This parameter can be overridden in line sections
; Defaults to disable
dtmfinband=enable


; ringback: boolean: Offer a ringback tone even if not provided by peer channel
; This requires ringback tone generation support from the analog circuit driver
;ringback=no

; debuglevel: integer: The debug level of this group
; Applied on reload
; Defaults to the current debug level if missing or invalid
; NOTE: If 0, no debug messages will be printed out from this group or lines belonging to it

;[line group-name/circuit-code] 
; This section is used to configure an analog line belonging to a group of lines
; The line address (group-name/circuit-code) will be used to route a call to it

; enable: boolean: This option is used to create or remove an analog line
; When removed, any active call on this line will remain (the line will be destroyed on termination)
; Applied on reload
; Defaults to yes
;enable=yes

; out-of-service: boolean: This option is used to put a line in out of service or in service state
; When out of service, no calls can be done through the line and any active call
; on this line will be terminated
; Applied on reload
; Defaults to no
;out-of-service=no

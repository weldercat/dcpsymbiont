remote signalling element
A module that multiplexes several TDM D-chan HDLC
links over SCTP SIGTRAN transport.

HDLC packets are encapsulated using HUA (HDLC user adaptation) - 
IUA-like packet format.

HUA transparently encapsulates any HDLC data (8- or 16-bits address), 
unlike the IUA that requires 16-bits address.
